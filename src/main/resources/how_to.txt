Sequence generator annotation for MongoDB database

* GenerateSequence - Create the @interface type with whatever the fields you want. This will act as the
annotation for out project
For this, Target is set to fields because our aim is to apply this annotation on fields and Retention is set to Runtime, so the
decision is taken only on runtime.
* Create an entity class (here document class) to represent the sequential data and to keep track of it (Here, it is DatabaseSequence)
* Create a GenerateSequenceService to interact with the sequence collection to dynamically create and update
sequence collection
* Now create annotation processor which will, fetch the fields of GenerateSequence annotation and process
them before converting the model object into mongodb document (Here, model object is customer)

I hope this will be useful for people who are learning spring boot and mongodb and for some experienced developers too.
Try implementing in your projects.

Have fun!
